[CODE]
1. Implement BestFS
    a. Needs to either be incremental, or return all the steps taken (for animation purposes)
    b. Implemented in LISP via Jathp? (I wonder if we could do it all in JS...)
    c. Using Manhattan (Taxicab) heuristic
        i. If there is a tie in the heuristic, always go left
    d. Can move up/down/left/right, but not diagonally
2. Graphics
    a. Output number of tiles on best path to the screen during animation
    b. Also output total number of steps taken during animation
3. Get the LISP BestFS code to talk to our p5 animation code
