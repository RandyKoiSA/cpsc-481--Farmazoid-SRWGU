BestFS: 
	In this project, we built a 2D grid of cells with a bot that discovers
	all the tiles. The bot starts in the upper-left, on red path tiles and
	black wall tiles, and tries to find the best path to the lower-right.
	The bot is displayed as a green circle and the bot's path is shown in 
	in smaller dots with a different color as it explores the tiles.
	If the bot sees a dead end, it does not explore that path. The algorithm
	implemented in this project is BestFS using:
	Jathp-List, P5, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
