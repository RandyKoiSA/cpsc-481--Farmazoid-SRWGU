The top todo list is high priority as others can be done later.

* Revise MoveFarmzoids: instead of moving randomly within the 8 cells, we use the pathfinder in project one to find plants that needs help based on the carried_supply variable in farmzoid.

* function SmudgepotPlantsAroundFarmzoids(row, col) line ~813 must be implemented. Need a way to display and remove it when necessary.

* FMS function can be refined for better decision making

* Need to have farmzoid remove dead plants.
